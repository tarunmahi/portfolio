2.this project shows us the details of a person in a subtle way,whereas the design and its components are worth using and creating.

## Structure
i have completed this website by creating four components namely 
* header
 * About
 * Interests
 * Footer

i added all theese components by using React components and rendered them together.

## Stylesheet
for styling i have used general css. for the container of all the above components i have used `CSS-GRID`.where i have contemplately used the grid templates function of both *rows* and *columns* .

## Challenges
1.combining the components without altering the css code was seemingly difficult as the design was changing everytime i added an component.!took more time while doing this...
